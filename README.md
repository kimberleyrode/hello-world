Hi, my name is Kimberley. I live in Mexico and am probably the nerdiest surfer in this town. I love nature, but sometimes find it too hot here to really enjoy the outdoors, so I'm hoping to travel again someday soon! 
I'm trying to understand very basic coding and GitHub. I'm not sure exactly where I'm going with this, where this will take me to, or even what the next step is to get I don't know where. But at least I'm trying.
